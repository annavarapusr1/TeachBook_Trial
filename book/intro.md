````{admonition} Interactive Pages---Use Python in your Browser!
    
This online textbook has a number of pages that are set up to be used interactively. You can use the "Live Code" button under the Rocket Ship icon in the top right to activate the interactive features and use Python interactively!

Sometimes the interactivity will involve completing an exercise, whereas on other pages it might simply provide the opportunity to edit the contents of code cells and execute it to explore the page contents interactively. Other pages may provide interactive figures (e.g., widgets).

This feature is supported by [TeachBooks](http://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/).
